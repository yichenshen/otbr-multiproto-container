# OpenThread Border Router Container for Silabs Multiprotocol

This is Silabs' forked OpenThread Border Router (otbr) for [multiprotocol support via CPCd](https://docs.silabs.com/openthread/latest/multiprotocol-solution-linux/building-otbr-locally) in a container.

This version of otbr can connect via cpc instead of directly via the device interface, allowing the device to be used for other protocols via [CPCd](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/cpc-daemon) like Zigbee. It can be paired directly with a [CPCd container](https://github.com/yichenshen/cpcd-container) as well.

## Setup

### Options

The same environment vars used for the [upstream](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/build-docker) otbr container are supported here too:

- OT_RCP_DEVICE: Specifies the connection to the Thread Radio Co-Processor (RCP).
  - Default: 'spinel+cpc://cpcd_0?iid=2&iid-list=0'
- OT_INFRA_IF: The network interface used for the adjacent infrastructure network (typically Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
  - Default: eth0
- OT_THREAD_IF: The network interface name used for the Thread network.
  - Default: wpan0
- OT_LOG_LEVEL: The verbosity level of logs generated by OpenThread.
  - Default: 3

## Running

### For testing

```bash
sudo podman run --name=otbr -it --rm --privileged --network=host -v /run/dbus:/run/dbus:rw -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm:rw -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro --device=/dev/net/tun oghcr.io/yichenshen/otbr-multiproto-container:latest
```

> Note that you need CPCd running when running with the default, which connects via CPC

> Also note that otbr requires a fair bit of privileges (rootful + network=host) because it needs to create and manage the Thread interface wpan0
